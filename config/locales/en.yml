  invitation_instructions: This is a quick way to bring a group of people into the system in one go. Enter a comma-separated list of names and email addresses (one person per line) and after a bit of checking and tweaking on the next page, each of those people will be invited into the system and issued an account with a vaguely adequate username and entirely random password. Anyone who is already here will just be added to the group.
  invitation_preview_instructions: Fields in red have validation problems. That usually means an email address or login needs checking. Hover your mouse pointer over the affected field to find out more. Fields in grey show that we already have that person here (based on their email address). You can still bring them into the group but you can't edit their details here.
